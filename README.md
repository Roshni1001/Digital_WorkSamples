# Digital_WorkSamples
Overview
Welcome to the Digital Work Samples repository! This repository contains a collection of detailed studies and project documentation focused on various aspects of digital circuit design and analysis. These projects showcase my hands-on experience and technical proficiency in the field of digital electronics.

Contents
Gate Structure Analysis: Comprehensive analysis of digital components such as IC LS7400 (NAND gates) and IC 74HC163N (4-bit binary counter). This includes studying their gate structures and understanding their operational characteristics.

Digital Circuit Design and Analysis: Detailed design and analysis of digital circuits using industry-standard software tools such as Pixelpulse2 and LT Spice. These tools were instrumental in simulating, designing, and optimizing the circuits.
